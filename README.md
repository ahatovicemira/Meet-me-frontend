# Meet me (frontend)

> The backend part can be found [here](https://github.com/ahatovicemira/Meet-me-backend).

This is the frontend part of my little two-part application. The project was written in React native and used Expo for easier development. The project was made as part of a University course. The goal was to learn some basics of React native and web communication.

## Try out
To try this app out, you can use the following Expo [link](https://snack.expo.io/@emira/meet-me---frontend).
